# Compliance and Data Usage

OpenJobsEU is designed with compliance and transparency as first-class concerns.

## Data Sources
The platform only processes job data obtained from:
- Public APIs
- Open job feeds (JSON/RSS)
- Explicit company submissions

## What We Do Not Do
- No scraping of closed or commercial job platforms 
- No bypassing of third-party protections
- No storage or redistribution of proprietary content

## Legal Boundaries
OpenJobsEU does not automate job posting to external platforms and does not interact with third-party systems on behalf of users.

Any future publishing-related functionality is designed as assisted, manual workflows only.
